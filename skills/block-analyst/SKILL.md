  Cross-venue analysis of Paradigm RFQ block trades using live market data from
  Deribit, OKX, and Bybit. Parses the trade JSON from the Paradigm block-trade
  tape, fetches live mark prices, IVs, and greeks from each venue, computes net
  portfolio greeks for multi-leg structures, benchmarks the fill against mark
  price cross-venue, checks tape history for matching structures in the last
  90 days, and outputs a concise analysis with full data-source trace. Use when
  the user pastes a Paradigm block trade JSON or asks to analyze, benchmark, or
  get market color on a specific Paradigm RFQ execution. Covers outright
  calls/puts (CL/PL), strangles (SN), straddles (ST), butterflies (BF), condors
  (CO), calendars (CA), risk reversals (RR), covered calls, and custom
  multi-leg combos (CM). Also handles perp combos with option and perp legs.
compatibility: No authentication required for market data. Works with
  deribit__get_ticker MCP (if available), web_fetch, or any injected DuckDB market
  data source. Falls back gracefully when venues are unreachable.

# Paradigm Block Trade Analyst

Cross-venue analysis of Paradigm RFQ executions against live Deribit, OKX, and
Bybit market data.

## Trigger

Fire when the user pastes a Paradigm block trade JSON object or references a
specific trade from the tape (e.g. "analyze this", "what's this trade doing",
"benchmark the fill", "pull live greeks").

## Step 1 — Parse the Trade

Extract from the JSON:

| Field | Use |
|---|---|
| `description` | Parse legs: direction (+ buy / - sell), ratio, instrument type, expiry, strike |
| `action` | Taker side: BUY = taker takes the structure as described; SELL = taker takes the opposite |
| `quantity` | Number of contracts |
| `price` | Fill price (in `quote_currency` units) |
| `mark_price` | Deribit mark at trade time |
| `displayValues.markOffset` | Fill vs mark: +/- premium |
| `index_price` | Spot at trade time |
| `strategy_code` | Structure type (see references/strategy-codes.md) |
| `rfqType` | `grfq` (multi-maker) or `drfq` (directed) |
| `venue` | `DBT` = Deribit, `BIT` = Bit.com, `OKX` = OKX |
| `product_codes` | `DO`/`EH` = BTC/ETH options; `DP`/`EP` = BTC/ETH perps |

**Leg parsing from `description`:**
- Format: `[+/-][ratio] [Type] [DD Mon YY] [Strike]`
- `+` = long, `-` = short; ratio is the leg multiplier
- Multiple legs separated by `\n`
- Single-leg trades: `description` is just the instrument name

**Action mapping:**
- `action: BUY` → taker holds legs exactly as signed in description
- `action: SELL` → taker holds all legs with flipped signs

## Step 2 — Fetch Live Data

Use whatever data sources are available — query all reachable venues in parallel.
See `references/venues.md` for exact endpoints, instrument naming, and limitations.

**Deribit (primary):**
Preferred: `deribit__get_ticker` per leg (native MCP, fastest).
Fallback: `web_fetch` on `https://www.deribit.com/api/v2/public/ticker?instrument_name=<name>`,
or any injected DuckDB table with current Deribit marks.
Returns mark price, bid/ask, mark IV, delta, gamma, theta, vega, OI.

**OKX (secondary — fetch when Deribit venue or cross-venue benchmark needed):**
Use `web_fetch` on the opt-summary endpoint. Returns mark IV and greeks for all
strikes of an expiry. OKX uses different strike grids — find nearest strike(s)
and interpolate if exact strike absent. See `references/venues.md`.

**Bybit (tertiary — check availability, use market module):**
Follow Bybit skill Module Router: load `modules/market.md`, then call
`GET /v5/market/tickers?category=option&baseCoin=BTC&expDate=<DDMMMYY>`.
Bybit frequently does not list short-dated (<3 DTE) or illiquid strikes —
empty list is an expected result, not an error.

## Step 3 — Tape History (last 90 days)

Search the Paradigm block-trade tape (or any injected trade-history source) for
prior fills with the same `strategy_code` and matching leg structure — same
underlying, same expiry pattern, and same strike geometry (absolute strikes for
short-dated, or moneyness/width for longer-dated) — over the last 90 days.

Capture:
- Count of matching trades and rough notional range
- Most recent occurrence (date + fill vs mark)
- Whether the structure looks like recurring flow or a one-off
- Same-side concentration if directionally meaningful (e.g. repeated put
  selling at the same strike)

If no historical source is available, record "tape history unavailable" in the
data trace and skip this section — do not fabricate counts.

## Step 4 — Compute Net Greeks

Apply leg ratios to per-instrument greeks. For taker side `SELL`, flip signs.

```
net_greek = Σ (taker_sign × leg_ratio × instrument_greek)
total_delta_btc = net_delta × quantity   (in BTC or ETH)
```

Report: delta, gamma, theta ($/day), vega. Scale to full position (× quantity).

## Step 5 — IV Skew & Cross-Venue Comparison

- Per-leg IV: Deribit mark IV (primary), OKX mark IV (secondary)
- IV differential between legs (put premium over call IV, calendar IV spread, etc.)
- Cross-venue IV spread: flag if >2 vol points divergence between Deribit and OKX
- Note if taker bought or sold the higher-IV leg (directional vs vol arb read)

## Step 6 — P&L Mark (if position is live / follow-up analysis)

```
structure_value_now = Σ (taker_sign × leg_ratio × current_mark_price)
entry_cost          = fill_price (positive = premium paid, negative = received)
mark_pnl_per_unit   = structure_value_now - entry_cost
total_pnl           = mark_pnl_per_unit × quantity × spot_price
```

Only compute P&L when asked or when the trade was previously analyzed in session.

## Step 7 — Output Format

**The output itself must be concise.** Prefer compact tables over prose,
short bullets over paragraphs, and skip sections that add no signal for the
specific trade. Aim for a response a trader can scan in under 15 seconds.

Structure:

1. **Structure** — one-line summary + legs table (direction, type, expiry, strike, ratio)
2. **Market Context** — spot, moneyness per leg, DTE — one line each
3. **Live Greeks** — single table: per-leg + net position row
4. **IV** — per-leg mark IV, cross-venue spread (omit if no divergence), one-line skew read
5. **History (90d)** — count, last occurrence, recurring/one-off — one or two lines (omit section entirely if tape history unavailable)
6. **View** — 1–2 sentences on directional/vol thesis, marked as inference
7. **Sizing** — notional, premium paid/received, mark offset, execution quality — one line
8. **Data Trace** — terse list: data point → source

Drop any section that would be empty or pure boilerplate. No restating of the
raw JSON. No hedging filler ("it's worth noting that…"). Tables > sentences.

## Notes

- For perp legs (`product_codes` includes `DP`/`EP`): fetch `BTC-PERPETUAL` /
  `ETH-PERPETUAL` mark price from available source; delta = ±1.0 per contract.
- For combo trades (option + perp), compute combined delta including perp leg.
- OKX uses USDC-margined options (`BTC-USD_UM`); prices are in BTC terms but
  Greeks may differ slightly from coin-margined Deribit options. Flag when relevant.
- If a venue returns no data, note it in the trace and proceed with available sources.
- See `references/venues.md` for instrument naming, endpoint quirks, and known gaps.
