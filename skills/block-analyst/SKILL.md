  Cross-venue analysis of Paradigm RFQ block trades using live market data from
  Deribit, OKX, and Bybit. Parses the trade JSON from the Paradigm block-trade
  tape, fetches live mark prices, IVs, and greeks from each venue, computes net
  portfolio greeks for multi-leg structures, benchmarks the fill against mark
  price cross-venue, and outputs a structured analysis with full data-source
  trace. Use when the user pastes a Paradigm block trade JSON or asks to analyze,
  benchmark, or get market color on a specific Paradigm RFQ execution. Covers
  outright calls/puts (CL/PL), strangles (SN), straddles (ST), butterflies (BF),
  condors (CO), calendars (CA), risk reversals (RR), covered calls, and custom
  multi-leg combos (CM). Also handles perp combos with option and perp legs.
compatibility: No authentication required for market data. Works with
  deribit__get_ticker MCP (if available), web_fetch, or any injected DuckDB market
  data source. Falls back gracefully when venues are unreachable.

# Paradigm Block Trade Analyst

Cross-venue analysis of Paradigm RFQ executions against live Deribit, OKX, and
Bybit market data.

## Trigger

Fire when the user pastes a Paradigm block trade JSON object or references a
specific trade from the tape (e.g. "analyze this", "what's this trade doing",
"benchmark the fill", "pull live greeks").

## Step 1 — Parse the Trade

Extract from the JSON:

| Field | Use |
|---|---|
| `description` | Parse legs: direction (+ buy / - sell), ratio, instrument type, expiry, strike |
| `action` | Taker side: BUY = taker takes the structure as described; SELL = taker takes the opposite |
| `quantity` | Number of contracts |
| `price` | Fill price (in `quote_currency` units) |
| `mark_price` | Deribit mark at trade time |
| `displayValues.markOffset` | Fill vs mark: +/- premium |
| `index_price` | Spot at trade time |
| `strategy_code` | Structure type (see references/strategy-codes.md) |
| `rfqType` | `grfq` (multi-maker) or `drfq` (directed) |
| `venue` | `DBT` = Deribit, `BIT` = Bit.com, `OKX` = OKX |
| `product_codes` | `DO`/`EH` = BTC/ETH options; `DP`/`EP` = BTC/ETH perps |

**Leg parsing from `description`:**
- Format: `[+/-][ratio] [Type] [DD Mon YY] [Strike]`
- `+` = long, `-` = short; ratio is the leg multiplier
- Multiple legs separated by `\n`
- Single-leg trades: `description` is just the instrument name

**Action mapping:**
- `action: BUY` → taker holds legs exactly as signed in description
- `action: SELL` → taker holds all legs with flipped signs

## Step 2 — Fetch Live Data

Use whatever data sources are available — query all reachable venues in parallel.
See `references/venues.md` for exact endpoints, instrument naming, and limitations.

**Deribit (primary):**
Preferred: `deribit__get_ticker` per leg (native MCP, fastest).
Fallback: `web_fetch` on `https://www.deribit.com/api/v2/public/ticker?instrument_name=<name>`,
or any injected DuckDB table with current Deribit marks.
Returns mark price, bid/ask, mark IV, delta, gamma, theta, vega, OI.

**OKX (secondary — fetch when Deribit venue or cross-venue benchmark needed):**
Use `web_fetch` on the opt-summary endpoint. Returns mark IV and greeks for all
strikes of an expiry. OKX uses different strike grids — find nearest strike(s)
and interpolate if exact strike absent. See `references/venues.md`.

**Bybit (tertiary — check availability, use market module):**
Follow Bybit skill Module Router: load `modules/market.md`, then call
`GET /v5/market/tickers?category=option&baseCoin=BTC&expDate=<DDMMMYY>`.
Bybit frequently does not list short-dated (<3 DTE) or illiquid strikes —
empty list is an expected result, not an error.

## Step 3 — Compute Net Greeks

Apply leg ratios to per-instrument greeks. For taker side `SELL`, flip signs.

```
net_greek = Σ (taker_sign × leg_ratio × instrument_greek)
total_delta_btc = net_delta × quantity   (in BTC or ETH)
```

Report: delta, gamma, theta ($/day), vega. Scale to full position (× quantity).

## Step 4 — IV Skew & Cross-Venue Comparison

- Per-leg IV: Deribit mark IV (primary), OKX mark IV (secondary)
- IV differential between legs (put premium over call IV, calendar IV spread, etc.)
- Cross-venue IV spread: flag if >2 vol points divergence between Deribit and OKX
- Note if taker bought or sold the higher-IV leg (directional vs vol arb read)

## Step 5 — P&L Mark (if position is live / follow-up analysis)

```
structure_value_now = Σ (taker_sign × leg_ratio × current_mark_price)
entry_cost          = fill_price (positive = premium paid, negative = received)
mark_pnl_per_unit   = structure_value_now - entry_cost
total_pnl           = mark_pnl_per_unit × quantity × spot_price
```

Only compute P&L when asked or when the trade was previously analyzed in session.

## Step 6 — Output Format

Structure the response as:

1. **Structure Breakdown** — legs table (direction, type, expiry, strike, ratio)
2. **Market Context** — spot at trade, moneyness per leg, DTE per leg
3. **Live Greeks** — table: per-leg instrument data + net position greeks
4. **IV Analysis** — mark IV per leg, cross-venue comparison, skew read
5. **View Expressed** — what directional/vol thesis the taker is expressing
6. **Sizing & Pricing** — notional, premium paid/received, mark offset, execution quality
7. **Data Source Trace** — which tool/endpoint was used for each data point

Keep the view section interpretive but clearly marked as inference, not fact.

## Notes

- For perp legs (`product_codes` includes `DP`/`EP`): fetch `BTC-PERPETUAL` /
  `ETH-PERPETUAL` mark price from available source; delta = ±1.0 per contract.
- For combo trades (option + perp), compute combined delta including perp leg.
- OKX uses USDC-margined options (`BTC-USD_UM`); prices are in BTC terms but
  Greeks may differ slightly from coin-margined Deribit options. Flag when relevant.
- If a venue returns no data, note it in the trace and proceed with available sources.
- See `references/venues.md` for instrument naming, endpoint quirks, and known gaps.
